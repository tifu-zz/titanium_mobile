examples: |
    ## write data to stream

      var outBuffer = Ti.createBuffer({data: "write me"});
      var outStream = // stream object could be socket, file, buffer or blob

      var bytesWritten = outStream.write(outBuffer);  // writes entire buffer to stream
      Ti.API.info("Bytes written:" + bytesWritten);  // should be 8

      bytesWritten = outStream.write(outBuffer, 2, 5);  // only writes "ite m" to stream
      Ti.API.info("Bytes written:" + bytesWritten);  // should be 5

    ## read data from stream

      var inBuffer = Ti.createBuffer({length: 1024});

      // assume the inStream contains the string "hello world"
      var inStream = // stream object could be socket, file, buffer or blob

      var bytesRead = inStream.read(inBuffer);  // reads "hello world" from stream
      Ti.API.info("Bytes read:" + bytesRead);  // should be 11

      bytesRead = inStream.read(inBuffer, 2, 5);  // only reads "llo w" from stream
      Ti.API.info("Bytes read:" + bytesRead);  // should be 5
