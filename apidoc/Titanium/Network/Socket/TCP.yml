name: Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP
type: Titanium.IOStream
description: TCP socket that implements the `Titanium.IOStream` interface.  Created by `Titanium.Network.Socket.createTCP`
extends: Titanium.Proxy
since: "1.7"

properties:
  - name: host
    type: String
    description: The host to connect to or listen on. Cannot be modified when not in the INITIALIZED state. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6

  - name: port
    type: Number
    description: The port to connect to or listen on. Cannot be modified when not in the INITIALIZED state

  - name: listenQueueSize
    type: Number
    description: Max number of pending incoming connections to be allowed when listen() is called. Any incoming connections received while the max number of pending connections has been reached will be rejected.

  - name: timeout
    type: Number
    description: The timeout for connect() and all I/O write() operations. Cannot be modified when not in the INITIALIZED state

  - name: connected
    type: Callback<ConnectedCallbackArgs>
    description: The callback to be fired after the socket enters the "connected" state. Only invoked following a successful connect() call

  - name: error
    type: Callback<ErrorCallbackArgs>
    description: The callback to be fired after the socket enters the ERROR state

  - name: accepted
    type: Callback<AcceptedCallbackArgs>
    description: The callback to be fired when a listener accepts a connection

  - name: state
    type: Number
    permission: read-only
    description: current state of the socket


methods:
  - name: connect
    description: Attempts to connect the socket to its host/port. Throws exception if the socket is in a CONNECTED or LISTENING state. Throws exception if a valid host and port has not been set on the proxy. Nonblocking; connection attempts are asynchronous

  - name: listen
    description: Attempts to start listening on the socket's host/port. listen() call will attempt to listen on the specified host and/or port property for the socket if they are set. This function blocks execution and throws an exception on error (and sets the socket state to ERROR) but does not fire the error callback in this event. Throws exception if the socket is in a LISTENING or CONNECTED state

  - name: accept
    description: Tells a LISTENING socket to accept a connection request at the top of a listener's request queue when one becomes available. Takes an argument, a box object which assigns callbacks to the created socket. Note that the connected callback is not called (the socket does not "transition to" the CONNECTED state - it's created in the CONNECTED state) on the newly created socket.  The accepted callback is called when a new connection is accepted as a result of calling accept().  If the socket is already flagged to accept the next connection, the existing accept options will be update to use the newly specified options object. Throws an exception if the socket is not in a LISTENING state
    parameters:
      - name: params
        description: parameters that contain callbacks to be set on next accepted socket
        type: AcceptParams

  - name: close
    description: Closes a socket. Throws exception if the socket is not in a CONNECTED or LISTENING state. Blocking
