toRecipients[array]: array of email recipients
bccRecipients[array]: array of email BCC: recipients
ccRecipients[array]: array of email CC: recipients
html[boolean]: boolean to indicate whether the email messageBody should be sent as HTML content type. defaults to false. (Android note: you should not use html messages in 1.6: after that is okay.)
barColor[string]: the bar color of the email dialog window when opened
SENT[int]: constant for the SENT status result
SAVED[int]: constant for the SAVED status result
CANCELLED[int]: constant for the CANCELLED status result
FAILED[int]: constant for the FAILED status result

- methods

isSupported: return whether or not sending email is supported
open: open the email dialog. the email dialog itself is a modal window
addAttachment: add an attachment to the email. The attachment can either be a Blob or File object. Note: Versions before 1.7.1 will only support one attachment in Android.  Since version 1.7.1, our Android implementation will accept multiple attachments, but multiple attachments will only work if the user chooses to send via the Android Gmail app; the Android "Mail" app (which is anyway not available on some handsets) will only accept one attachment from a Titanium app.  K9 has also been tested successfully with multiple attachments.

- method : open

properties[object]: object of animation properties. pass `animated` property (as boolean) to indicate if the dialog should be animated on open.

- method : addAttachment

attachment[object]: attachment object as either a Blob or File object

- events

complete: fired when the email dialog has completed sending the email

- event : complete

result: result status either as SENT, SAVED, CANCELLED or FAILED. (Note: Android result will be SENT even if user discards or saves the message.  SAVED and CANCELLED are not supported on Android.)
success: boolean to indicate if the email was successfully sent
error: string message of the error or null if successfully sent


- example : Simple Email Dialog with Attachment

In this example, we send an email with a file attachment.

~~~
var emailDialog = Titanium.UI.createEmailDialog()
emailDialog.subject = "Hello from Titanium";
emailDialog.toRecipients = ['foo@yahoo.com'];
emailDialog.messageBody = '<b>Appcelerator Titanium Rocks!</b>';
var f = Ti.Filesystem.getFile('cricket.wav');
emailDialog.addAttachment(f);
emailDialog.open();
